# We canâ€™t modify the elements of a tuple, but we can make a variable reference a
# new tuple holding different information. Thankfully we can also use the slice
# operation on tuples as well as strings and lists. To construct the new tuple, we
# can slice parts of the old tuple and join up the bits to make the new tuple. So
# julia has a new recent film, and we might want to change her tuple. We can
# easily slice off the parts we want and concatenate them with the new tuple.
